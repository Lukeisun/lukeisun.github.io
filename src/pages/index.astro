				Hi, I'm Adin Lukas, and you're welcome to call
				me by either name -- I like both.
			</h1>
			<p>
				I am currently a Software Test Engineer at Bogen
				Communications. I have graduated from the
				University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's
				in Computer Science. I enjoy the fields of
				Computer Vision, Math, and Backend Engineering.
				My personal hobbies include gaming <img

					alt="cs2"
					class="game"
				/>, enjoying time with my wife, and learning new
				things (recently homelabbing!). Some parts of
				the page are not fully functional, I'm
				experimenting with different things but think I
				am going to stick with Astro :)
