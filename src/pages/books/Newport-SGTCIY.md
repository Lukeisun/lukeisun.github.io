Cal Newport's "So Good They Can't Ignore You" is a really interesting book, the main premise of the book is that
following a passion is bad career advice. I found the message immediately compelling as this idea had been brewing
in my mind since my driving test, where I had a pleasant conversation with an Uber driver after I had passed. The conversation had shifted towards the topic shifted towards me and my own career; I was in the process of my last semester
and was gearing up to enter the workforce. At some point he had asked me
> "Do you enjoy what you do?"

"I don't know, I like it I guess but I wouldn't say I'm passionate about it"

> "Well y'know sometimes you just have to make it your passion"

His response surprised me, I have never encountered this line of thinking before. People always talk about their passions
as some sort of God given purpose, I didn't ever really think I had a true passion. I mean, there was stuff I liked 
but never felt this sense of *passion*. It really stuck with me, I got home and thought about it and those seemingly
small words had a huge impact in my thinking-even now.

I believe that Newport's book is a more formalized version of this line of thought. The book heavily emphasizes
approaching a career in terms of what you can provide to a company, what the book calls a craftsman mindset.
And for you to be valuable to an employer (maybe the world?) you must possess rare and valuable skills (career capital).
Where I think that Newport's message aligns most with the Uber drivers words is in the books words about how people 
who are happy in their career, even in less sexy jobs, are people who have spent *a lot* of time in their professions 
and they have gotten *good*.

The book along with the Uber drive have really inspired me in my own path. I have taken a more targeted approach
towards my self and career. I want to build more projects, and I am doing so through this website and the 
[got](https://adinlukas.xyz/blog/got_day_one/) project. I want to have stronger fundamentals and for this I have 
purchased CTCI, Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual, and SICP. I have also applied for an online masters at Georgia 
Tech (best of luck to future me!). The one thing I am missing and don't have a great idea on how to implement is 
networking. I'm not a super social person, I struggle with putting my self out there. But I'm hoping that being
active in some discord communities and writing this blog that I can be better at networking.

As for my only problem with the book, personally it made me feel like you can really only be successful if you have
attended an Ivy/MIT/Stanford/ any other prestigious university. For context, a large chunk of the book is reading
about other peoples career paths and how they apply to Newport's philosophy. I'm sure it's not intentional, as
Newport is MIT alumni and perhaps found it easier to relate to these individuals. But it does make me feel a tad bit 
shitty as it is the common denominator between most of the people mentioned in the book. This seems to be a somewhat
common complaint in the reviews on Amazon.

Overall I recommend the book to other new grads/those starting in their careers. I have learned that the world gets 
much more complicated and confusing once you're in the real world. The book helps to make more sense out of it and gives
some direction. 

Thanks for reading ❤️
