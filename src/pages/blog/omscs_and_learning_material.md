## OMSCS
OMSCS requires 10 courses. I plan on doing the Computing Systems specialization 
and there are 6 courses I need to take within that specialization. I then have
4 remaining "free" courses. Most of my courses are within my specialization so 
I don't think I have to worry. I do have more than 10 courses and that is because 
I'm indecisive :D.
